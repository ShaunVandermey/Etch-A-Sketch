# Etch-A-Sketch
Flexing my HTML, CSS, and vailla JS muscles with an interactive Etch-A-Sketch website.

A simple drawing program made by recolouring div elements to create a pixelated drawing. You can use the UI to change the size of the image, or to change the active colour that changes the colours of the squares.

There's a limit to how many rows/columns you can resize it to, because machines with lesser memory have a harder time rendering too many objects on the screen.
